To Do:
 - Make this file create a UI to select which mini game to play
 - Have the file iterate through each file in the project, and create a button for it labeled with the file name
 - This button will then run the associated game file, and upon exiting will return to the main.py menu
 - The main.py buttons should also include an exit button to exit the entire project
